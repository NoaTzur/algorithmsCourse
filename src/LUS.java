    1.If both the strings are identical, for example: “ac” and “ac”,
            it is obvious that no subsequence will be uncommon. Hence, return 0.

    2.If length(a) = length(b) and a ? b, for example: “abcdef” and “defghi”,
            out of these two strings one string will never be a subsequence of other string.
            Hence, return length(a) or length(b).

    3.If length(a) ? length(b), for example: “abcdabcd” and “abcabc”,
            in this case we can consider bigger string as a required subsequence because bigger string can not be a subsequence of
            smaller string.
            Hence, return max(length(a), length(b)).
