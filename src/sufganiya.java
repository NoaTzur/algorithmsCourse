public class sufganiya {


    /*

    F(n,k,p) = n

    n = number of sufganyut
    k = place in the frying pan
    p = dimension of each sufgaiya

    PROOF:

    when n - number of sufganiya is even,  n=2*m
    we will fill the pan with pairs of sufg.
    so in each pan will be 2 sufg, 1 minutes to each pair
    so for 1 pair its 2 minutes,
    for m pairs its 2*m minutes !
    2*m = n !!

    when n is odd number, n=2*m +1
    we will split it like this : 2(m-1) pairs , that equals to 2m -2 (open the brackets) so 3 sufg is left ! (to reach 2*m+1)
    (2m+1 -(2m-2)) = (2m+1-2m+2) = 3
    so for the 3 sufgan its 3 minutes - we see this example in class
    so (2(m-1) pairs its even like we see when n=even number that this is 2(m-1) minutes
    and more 3 minutes for the 3 sufganiyut left => 2(m-1) + 3 = 2m+1 = n !!
    so n minutes
